I hereby assure that my submission is in line with the *Code of Conduct* outlined

### General setup

Before I start the project, I clear my workspace and install (if necessary) and 
load the packages that are needed for the assignment.

```{r general, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results = 'hide'}
rm(list = ls())

#if (!require("")) install.packages("")


#library()
setwd("C:/Users/Kai Brehm/Desktop/Uni/3. Semester/DSPM/Excercises/DSPM_Assignment_V")

```
